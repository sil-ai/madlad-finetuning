In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.,Hapo mwanzo Mungu aliumba mbingu na dunia.
"The earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the waters.","Wakati huu dunia ilikuwa haina umbo, tena ilikuwa tupu. Giza lilikuwa juu ya uso wa vilindi vya maji, naye Roho wa Mungu alikuwa ametulia juu ya maji."
"Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.","Mungu akasema, “Iwepo nuru,” nayo nuru ikawepo."
God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.,"Mungu akaona ya kuwa nuru ni njema, ndipo Mungu akatenganisha nuru na giza."
"God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.","Mungu akaiita nuru “mchana,” na giza akaliita “usiku.” Ikawa jioni, ikawa asubuhi, siku ya kwanza."
"Then God said, “Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”","Mungu akasema, “Iwepo nafasi kati ya maji igawe maji na maji.”"
"God made the expanse, and separated the waters which were below the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.","Kwa hiyo Mungu akafanya nafasi, akatenganisha maji yaliyo chini ya hiyo nafasi na maji yaliyo juu yake. Ikawa hivyo."
"God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.","Mungu akaiita hiyo nafasi “anga.” Ikawa jioni, ikawa asubuhi, siku ya pili."
"Then God said, “Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so.","Mungu akasema, “Maji yaliyopo chini ya anga na yakusanyike mahali pamoja, pawepo na nchi kavu.” Ikawa hivyo."
"God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas; and God saw that it was good.","Mungu akaiita nchi kavu “ardhi,” nalo lile kusanyiko la maji akaliita “bahari.” Mungu akaona kuwa ni vyema."
